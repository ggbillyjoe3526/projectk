 * One tab plays at a time, so two tabs never write over each other's save: tabs of the game talk on a
 * BroadcastChannel. A tab starting up asks whether another is playing; one is, so it waits behind a notice (Play here).
 * Play here asks the playing tab to let go: that tab writes what it holds, stops saving and shows the notice in turn,
 * and the new one reloads so it reads the save as just written.
 *
 * Where the browser has Web Locks (every supported browser), the save is an exclusive lock: whoever holds it plays, and a
 * tab that can't get it waits, however busy the playing tab is. Without them, a tab starting up asks on the channel and
 * plays if nobody answers in time; two tabs starting at the same instant both hear nobody, each then says it is
 * playing, and the one with the lower id keeps the save while the other lets go.
