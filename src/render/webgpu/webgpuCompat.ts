/**
 * Browser differences the renderer meets on WebGPU, both found in Chromium 141 (the
 * container's) by pipeline/webgpu-compare.mjs; each is tested for on the device and fitted only where it is found.
 *
 * - **The string swizzle.** Three 0.186 passes every texture view a `swizzle` of `'rgba'` (the WebGPU spec's string,
 *   for the `texture-component-swizzle` feature). Builds of the feature's first draft type that member as a dictionary
 *   and reject the string, so the first texture view a frame makes throws and the game stops on its crash screen. The
 *   member is cleared before each view is made (`undefined` reads as absent: the identity swizzle Three asked for).
 * - **Layers written into a 3D texture that may be drawn into.** Three gives every texture `RENDER_ATTACHMENT` use, and
 *   writes a 3D texture a layer at a time (the baked light's grid, render/bakedLight.ts); Dawn there clears such a
 *   texture first through a 2D view of it, which is invalid, so the grid is never uploaded and every surface reading it
 *   fails to draw (a whole map went black). The game draws into no 3D texture, so its 3D textures are made without that use.
 *
 * The browser's own `GPUTexture.prototype.createView` and `GPUDevice.prototype.createTexture` are wrapped once per page,
 * by the first node renderer that finds the difference; each wrap writes into the descriptor it is given (Three reuses
 * its own), so it allocates nothing.
